        "body": "strange. The linked page says \"Canada should run security checks on all international students\". It didn't exactly mention \"Canadians increasingly angered by amount of international students, want increased deportations for expired visas.\" \n\nis this a rage bait? \n\nAnd immigration do require security checks for international students - Depending on your country of origin or application circumstances, **IRCC may ask you for a police certificate** to ensure there's no criminal conviction or security risk. \n\nper diploma mills, it's a known issue. Canada has tightened on immigration, study/work permits. Many uninformed comments there about how international student permits and visas work. Not everyone has an easy pathways to PR, citizenships, or jobs. This is all very rage bait and a big distraction to deeper issues globally (not just canada).",
