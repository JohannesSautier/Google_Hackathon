During the 2022/23 recruitment hype, it actually worked out. He received an offer from us and moved to Europe with the Bluecard. I was his contact person for questions of all kinds in the early days. After the first payslip, he came to me all upset that something might be wrong because so much had been deducted. Out of 6.5k, he had only been paid around 3.7k net. I looked at it and everything was correct. He simply hadn't checked what he had to pay in taxes and mandatory social security contributions. He then resigned after 6 months, also on the grounds that after deducting all costs (high rents in the city, food costs, costs for driver's license and car, other obligatory contributions etc.) there was too little left to save.",

    "selftext": "My\\_Qualifications:\n\n(my life story- skip this if not interested)\n\n23 years ago I did the biggest crime known to humanity: I was born a middle-class Indian male. 7 years ago, I did the second biggest crime: I didn't take science in 11th and 12th. After 12th was completed, I was resolute on leaving the country to pursue a new life in a new nation. Alas, covid was in full swing, and my dad advised me to stay back and complete my graduation, and then apply for masters.\n\nSo, I persevered. Once I completed my graduation, I yet again looked across the horizon, for new opportunities. I did thorough research and applied to only one country. I even joined a counselling service so nothing could go wrong. When they asked me some preliminary questions, I aced all of them, and I even provided them with information about the country they didn't even know. I was so confident that I left the service, applied to several colleges, accepted in a few, and then the visa all on my own. Then, the train hit- my visa was rejected. The degree I had chosen was worth it in only that country, and anywhere else would be a colossal waste of money. Most of the good university applications were closed anyway, so I had no choice but to stay back and take a drop.\n\nI was devasted. By now, most of my sheeple engineering friends were already abroad. I wasted so much time and money and now I had a useless degree and no job prospects. By some miracle, I one day received a call from my old counselling service. They had heard about my failure but were so impressed with my research that they offered me a job lmao. Seeing no other option, I took up the job. It's a local service and the pay is decent. So, now I help students accomplish what I couldn't do- send them abroad.\n\n(Read from here if you skipped)\n\nI don't accept money for anything here, as I genuinely just want to help students make good decisions in their lives, which I couldn't. I've been working for a year, and I have seen some repetitive mistakes that a lot of students make, that I see on this subreddit as well. There are general trends in countries, and the most recent one seems to be Germany. I understand the desperation of many people who want to leave the country, but you need to understand that the year or two you spend doing a masters now will cost you the rest of your life.\n\nCalm down, evaluate your options, research whether your course is valuable in that country, research the politics, economics and history of every country you're applying to if your goal is a PR. I have seen so many students my counselling service sent abroad now return to their hometowns because they take up the first university they get an offer from. Some can't even point the country on a map and they want a PR there!  \nI spend most of my free time reading articles and watching youtube videos related to this, as it is literally my job. So, if you're planning on moving to another country as a student, AMA.\n\nNOTE: please don't DM me and ask your questions publicly.

[click here, if you are asking a question.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indians_StudyAbroad/wiki/prior_reserch_before_posting_a_question) \n\n  * 1] Have you done thorough [prior research](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indians_StudyAbroad/wiki/prior_reserch_before_posting_a_question)?\n  \n  * 2] Are your qualifications are mentioned in **Post Title**? (e.g. 10th/12th student, Mechanical BE student, working professional, etc.) Currently your post title is **\" I get paid to send studenets abroad. I do it free on reddit. AMA \"**\n\n  backup of your post content: \n\n  My\\_Qualifications: \n\n(my life story- skip this if not interested)\n\n23 years ago I did the biggest crime known to humanity: I was born a middle-class Indian male. 7 years ago, I did the second biggest crime: I didn't take science in 11th and 12th. After 12th was completed, I was resolute on leaving the country to pursue a new life in a new nation. Alas, covid was in full swing, and my dad advised me to stay back and complete my graduation, and then apply for masters. \n\nSo, I persevered. Once I completed my graduation, I yet again looked across the horizon, for new opportunities. I did thorough research and applied to only one country. I even joined a counselling service so nothing could go wrong. When they asked me some preliminary questions, I aced all of them, and I even provided them with information about the country they didn't even know. I was so confident that I left the service, applied to several colleges, accepted in a few, and then the visa all on my own. Then, the train hit- my visa was rejected. The degree I had chosen was worth it in only that country, and anywhere else would be a colossal waste of money. Most of the good university applications were closed anyway, so I had no choice but to stay back and take a drop.\n\nI was devasted. By now, most of my sheeple engineering friends were already abroad. I wasted so much time and money and now I had a useless degree and no job prospects. By some miracle, I one day received a call from my old counselling service. They had heard about my failure but were so impressed with my research that they offered me a job lmao. Seeing no other option, I took up the job. It's a local service and the pay is decent. So, now I help students accomplish what I couldn't do- send them abroad.\n\n  \n(Read from here if you skipped)\n\n  \nI don't accept money for anything here, as I genuinely just want to help students make good decisions in their lives, which I couldn't. I've been working for a year, and I have seen some repetitive mistakes that a lot of students make, that I see on this subreddit as well. There are general trends in countries, and the most recent one seems to be Germany. I understand the desperation of many people who want to leave the country, but you need to understand that the year or two you spend doing a masters now will cost you the rest of your life. \n\nCalm down, evaluate your options, research whether your course is valuable in that country, research the politics, economics and history of every country you're applying to if your goal is a PR. I have seen so many students my counselling service sent abroad now return to their hometowns because they take up the first university they get an offer from. Some can't even point the country on a map and they want a PR there!   \nI spend most of my free time reading articles and watching youtube videos related to this, as it is literally my job.

My main obstacle is my CGPA in Electronics engineering (5.8).  Multiple people have suggested me to take GRE and pursue MS in US, for which I would have to take a loan. However seeing the saturation in IT sector rn, as well as the drop in placements this year, makes me doubtful whether this would be a fruitful investment.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on what career paths I can look up from here?",

But everywhere I see it all comes down to speaking german fluently or you won't get a job. So I'm confused about it. But I'm planning to finish till A2 level while I work for 2 years.\n\nAnother country I had in mind was netherlands because it being an English speaking country. But the cost of studying and the living expenses sums up to a pretty hefty amount. I've researched about some universities and the scholarships they offer but I would like to know about the chances of me getting it or on other words how many students would get it out of all the students that apply.\n\nAnd it would also be great of you could suggest me some countries. My budget being around 35 L.\n\nThanks in advance!",
