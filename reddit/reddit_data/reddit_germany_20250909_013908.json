Please use these resources. If you post questions that are easily answered, our regulars will point you to those resources anyway. Additionally, please use the **Reddit search**.

The ratio is probably 70%-30%.\n\nWhen I see them I can already expect to get nihao‘s in a mocking tone, or other „Chinese sounding“ words thrown at me, some guys yell their cat/dog-meat-order (e.g. „hundefleisch Nummer 39“)💀 \n\nI don’t recommend it but sometimes I just show them the middle finger which they often are very surprised at. Most Asians probably don’t react to the racism because that’s what people recommend so the racist guys were confused how to react to my simple middle finger lol\nBut sometimes it gets very dangerous, I am just 156cm tall and female, and the groups of guys often are two heads taller than me. I can’t recommend to fight back but in my experience, I can sleep peacefully at night, knowing that I fought back when this happens. Otherwise we remember these incidents for days or weeks or even longer and ruminate about what we should have done. Instead I remember their confused angry faces when i insult them back and can sleep peacefully to that😂\n\nBut I am really sad about this, these guys look like they’re from a group that already experience so much racism and get a bad presentation in the media, why are they racist themselves💀 I just don’t get how they think that racism is funny💀",

Hit submit.\n\nThen… silence.\n\nNo confirmation from the Finanzamt. No feedback. Nothing.\n\nTurns out: WISO filled in a wrong tax number (Steuernummer) - from a different Finanzamt. It looked fine in the UI, there was no warning, and I had no idea this was a problem. I only found out 3 months later, after I asked the Finanzamt directly, and they told me:\n\n>This number isn't valid for your address. You need to submit again, using the correct one. And no, we can't forward your old declaration.\n\nI get it: I made a mistake. But what kills me is this:\n\n* Nobody ever told me anything was wrong.\n* No rejection, no bounce, no notification - just nothing.\n\nLike my entire submission disappeared into a bureaucratic black hole. The only way to find out? Call or send a physical letter to a person with a fixed office schedule. Email? No. That would be too modern. We have data protection, you know.\n\nMeanwhile, WISO says:\n\n>You should have double-checked the number. We can't re-submit for you.\n\nThis whole system acts like it's still 1999. \n\n* Want to fix a tiny mistake? Do it all over again.\n* Want to ask a question? Use snail mail. \n* Want to follow up? Good luck finding someone who replies.\n\nAnd yet - this is the same country that says it needs highly qualified immigrants. That it wants to digitize. That it has shortages of skilled workers.\n\nSeriously?\n\nIf you try to do things right, you just get punched in the face by Kafka wrapped in Deutsche Post. At this point I don't even care about the money anymore. I just want to know:\n\n🧵 Is there anyone who filed their tax return in Germany and came out sane?\n\nOr is this… normal?",

    "selftext": "\\*\\*\\*I posted this a few days ago, but was then deleted due to community's rule violation (my fault, my first proper Reddit post). Only today I have the time to redo and post it again.\n\nJust want to vent, because currently it feels like life is punching me in the face repeatedly, despite all my effort. \n\nI'm from a South East Asian country, came to Germany 6 years ago, and went the usual path for a foreigner student: studienkolleg, bachelor, master, and then hopefully getting a white collar job. I always aware that I'm in disadvantage to others because I'm an immigrant, so since day 1 I knew I had to give my best.\n\nI finished bachelor and my master (electrical engineering- but leaning more on software development side) both in German and in standard study time with 1.x final score (about to submit master thesis). From 4. semester in bachelor, I started working as working student and intern, and then did my bachelor thesis in a top tier supplier in the industry as software developer. During master, I worked part time in another international company, also as developer. Currently, I'm writing thesis in that company too and will submit it in a few weeks. \n\nFor the last 6 years, I tried my best to prepare myself for working life. I studied well, like and understand what I learned. Many Profs like me for being the textbook \"good\" and hardworking student. I also know I need to have practical experience, so as soon as I felt ready, I started working in related field. In both companies, colleagues liked me, I finished the tasks well and on time. \n\nI passed Goethe German B2 back home, and by finishing the Studienkolleg and Bachelor in German, I'm officially qualified as C1. All of my job interviews were in German. The main language struggle I have is with daily German language, which is much different from the Hochdeutsch I'm so used to. So I try my best to improve German by self learning, always use German even English is also an option, such as at work or joining sport clubs full of German.\n\nI thought if I try my best to prepare myself, at the end of the day I would at the end of the day be rewarded.\n\nNow, to the punching part:\n\nEarlier this year, while writing my thesis, my boss mentioned a full time open position in my team and if I'm interested after my thesis. Hell yes. I even have talked to an upper manager as part of the process (internal recruiting, so chance was really high, they tried to fill the position for over a year by then). Everything seemed on track.\n\nBoom, by June, due to the shitty economy situation, management stops hiring for that position and wait till next year. Suddenly, now I have to scramble to apply for a job while writing my thesis. That stings. \n\nAfter 2 months, over 70 applications, HR interviews with 2 companies, leading to 1 last technical round, which went really well, with last 5 candidates left, then simply rejected. I politely asked the interviewer for reasons why I'm rejected and feedback and got ghosted. Feel like after all I did the last 6 years, I'm not good enough, so I'm extremely demotivated.  \nAfter a week of encouraging myself, that maybe it's not all bad. After thesis, I'm still allowed to be a student for a semester (stated in the rules of my uni), so I can go back as working student at my company, working parttime, still can finance myself while having time doing side projects, improving my skills. I mentioned to my manager a few weeks ago, he said great (he had tried for a while to help me somehow stay in the company till the other position is opened again) and will talk to HR about that. \n\nA few days ago he told me that, according to HR, despite still registered as student at my uni, due to some holy Germany laws, as soon as I finished all classes and submit my thesis, I'm not allowed to work as Werkstudent anymore, therefore they or any other companies can't hire me. :D\n\nI now cant find student job at any other company (no one hires ones with only 1 semester left) and will have no income after this month, so my only choice is to find a fulltime job. I know it has only been a few months and my case is still not the end of the world, but its just that after several years of truly maximal efforts, things just don't work out because of factors that I have so little control of. And the fact that it comes subsequently in a short amount of time feels like being punched repeatedly in the face....\n\nSome further background info:\n\nI am not EU citizen, have a student visa, so Bürgergeld and BAföG or anything similar are not an option for me. I am still enrolled to my uni until April, so visa is fortunately still not a problem (yet). I have a small savings, enough for a few months, but if the job search takes too long, then part time job is a must then.\n\nI really don't want to sound cocky, but based on reviews of fellow students, profs and my white collar friends, my resume is really good. For my second student job, I received 3 job offers after 10 days of applying (God bless the job market back then, too). But of course, I will still try improving my CV as well, based on some suggestions from the last post.\n\nTL;DR: 6 years as immigrant in Germany, did bachelor’s and master’s (standard study period, good grades, lots of working student, integrated into German culture). Thought I’d set myself up for a smooth start into working life. Full-time job offer disappeared because of hiring freeze, student job option blocked by law, now stuck applying in a bad economy with only rejections. Feeling exhausted and demotivated.\n\n\nEDIT:\nWow, thanks everyone for your kind words and for further helps. Reading your comments and stories makes me feel Im not alone in this. Hope we would all soon overcome this terrible period. \nBtw, because some have mentioned: I studied Electrical Engineering but lean more onto the software development side, proficient in C++, Python and looking for a IT job in cities around Frankfurt am Main (sadly moving is not an option for me due because I just moved recently). If someone knows about a matching position somewhere, I would love to learn more about it and we could discuss more in DM. Thanksss everyone",

Isn't it more patriotic to stay in a flawed country and work to make the country a better place? \n\nI believe \"patriotism,\" defined as the unconditional love of your country, is definitely a flawed trait to have. But patriotism defined as the desire to make the place you live better is definitely a trait to admire.\n\nOf course, some people's idea of making a place \"better\" is getting rid of all the colored folk.

Thankfully I know better now😂).\n\nI also experience this kind of „dumb racism“ from mostly Arabic speaking men (never women lol) but also a lot from Austrian men (at least the ones I confronted spoke with an Austrian accent), probably because I’m from Munich which is near the austrian border. The ratio is probably 70%-30%.\n\nWhen I see them I can already expect to get nihao‘s in a mocking tone, or other „Chinese sounding“ words thrown at me, some guys yell their cat/dog-meat-order (e.g. „hundefleisch Nummer 39“)💀 \n\nI don’t recommend it but sometimes I just show them the middle finger which they often are very surprised at. Most Asians probably don’t react to the racism because that’s what people recommend so the racist guys were confused how to react to my simple middle finger lol\nBut sometimes it gets very dangerous, I am just 156cm tall and female, and the groups of guys often are two heads taller than me. I can’t recommend to fight back but in my experience, I can sleep peacefully at night, knowing that I fought back when this happens. Otherwise we remember these incidents for days or weeks or even longer and ruminate about what we should have done. Instead I remember their confused angry faces when i insult them back and can sleep peacefully to that😂\n\nBut I am really sad about this, these guys look like they’re from a group that already experience so much racism and get a bad presentation in the media, why are they racist themselves💀 I just don’t get how they think that racism is funny💀",

Hit submit.\n\nThen… silence.\n\nNo confirmation from the Finanzamt. No feedback. Nothing.\n\nTurns out: WISO filled in a wrong tax number (Steuernummer) - from a different Finanzamt. It looked fine in the UI, there was no warning, and I had no idea this was a problem. I only found out 3 months later, after I asked the Finanzamt directly, and they told me:\n\n>This number isn't valid for your address. You need to submit again, using the correct one. And no, we can't forward your old declaration.\n\nI get it: I made a mistake. But what kills me is this:\n\n* Nobody ever told me anything was wrong.\n* No rejection, no bounce, no notification - just nothing.\n\nLike my entire submission disappeared into a bureaucratic black hole. The only way to find out? Call or send a physical letter to a person with a fixed office schedule. Email? No. That would be too modern. We have data protection, you know.\n\nMeanwhile, WISO says:\n\n>You should have double-checked the number. We can't re-submit for you.\n\nThis whole system acts like it's still 1999. \n\n* Want to fix a tiny mistake? Do it all over again.\n* Want to ask a question? Use snail mail. \n* Want to follow up? Good luck finding someone who replies.\n\nAnd yet - this is the same country that says it needs highly qualified immigrants. That it wants to digitize. That it has shortages of skilled workers.\n\nSeriously?\n\nIf you try to do things right, you just get punched in the face by Kafka wrapped in Deutsche Post. At this point I don't even care about the money anymore. I just want to know:\n\n🧵 Is there anyone who filed their tax return in Germany and came out sane?\n\nOr is this… normal?",

    "selftext": "\\*\\*\\*I posted this a few days ago, but was then deleted due to community's rule violation (my fault, my first proper Reddit post). Only today I have the time to redo and post it again.\n\nJust want to vent, because currently it feels like life is punching me in the face repeatedly, despite all my effort. \n\nI'm from a South East Asian country, came to Germany 6 years ago, and went the usual path for a foreigner student: studienkolleg, bachelor, master, and then hopefully getting a white collar job. I always aware that I'm in disadvantage to others because I'm an immigrant, so since day 1 I knew I had to give my best.\n\nI finished bachelor and my master (electrical engineering- but leaning more on software development side) both in German and in standard study time with 1.x final score (about to submit master thesis). From 4. semester in bachelor, I started working as working student and intern, and then did my bachelor thesis in a top tier supplier in the industry as software developer. During master, I worked part time in another international company, also as developer. Currently, I'm writing thesis in that company too and will submit it in a few weeks. \n\nFor the last 6 years, I tried my best to prepare myself for working life. I studied well, like and understand what I learned. Many Profs like me for being the textbook \"good\" and hardworking student. I also know I need to have practical experience, so as soon as I felt ready, I started working in related field. In both companies, colleagues liked me, I finished the tasks well and on time. \n\nI passed Goethe German B2 back home, and by finishing the Studienkolleg and Bachelor in German, I'm officially qualified as C1. All of my job interviews were in German. The main language struggle I have is with daily German language, which is much different from the Hochdeutsch I'm so used to. So I try my best to improve German by self learning, always use German even English is also an option, such as at work or joining sport clubs full of German.\n\nI thought if I try my best to prepare myself, at the end of the day I would at the end of the day be rewarded.\n\nNow, to the punching part:\n\nEarlier this year, while writing my thesis, my boss mentioned a full time open position in my team and if I'm interested after my thesis. Hell yes. I even have talked to an upper manager as part of the process (internal recruiting, so chance was really high, they tried to fill the position for over a year by then). Everything seemed on track.\n\nBoom, by June, due to the shitty economy situation, management stops hiring for that position and wait till next year. Suddenly, now I have to scramble to apply for a job while writing my thesis. That stings. \n\nAfter 2 months, over 70 applications, HR interviews with 2 companies, leading to 1 last technical round, which went really well, with last 5 candidates left, then simply rejected. I politely asked the interviewer for reasons why I'm rejected and feedback and got ghosted. Feel like after all I did the last 6 years, I'm not good enough, so I'm extremely demotivated.  \nAfter a week of encouraging myself, that maybe it's not all bad. After thesis, I'm still allowed to be a student for a semester (stated in the rules of my uni), so I can go back as working student at my company, working parttime, still can finance myself while having time doing side projects, improving my skills. I mentioned to my manager a few weeks ago, he said great (he had tried for a while to help me somehow stay in the company till the other position is opened again) and will talk to HR about that. \n\nA few days ago he told me that, according to HR, despite still registered as student at my uni, due to some holy Germany laws, as soon as I finished all classes and submit my thesis, I'm not allowed to work as Werkstudent anymore, therefore they or any other companies can't hire me. :D\n\nI now cant find student job at any other company (no one hires ones with only 1 semester left) and will have no income after this month, so my only choice is to find a fulltime job. I know it has only been a few months and my case is still not the end of the world, but its just that after several years of truly maximal efforts, things just don't work out because of factors that I have so little control of. And the fact that it comes subsequently in a short amount of time feels like being punched repeatedly in the face....\n\nSome further background info:\n\nI am not EU citizen, have a student visa, so Bürgergeld and BAföG or anything similar are not an option for me. I am still enrolled to my uni until April, so visa is fortunately still not a problem (yet). I have a small savings, enough for a few months, but if the job search takes too long, then part time job is a must then.\n\nI really don't want to sound cocky, but based on reviews of fellow students, profs and my white collar friends, my resume is really good. For my second student job, I received 3 job offers after 10 days of applying (God bless the job market back then, too). But of course, I will still try improving my CV as well, based on some suggestions from the last post.\n\nTL;DR: 6 years as immigrant in Germany, did bachelor’s and master’s (standard study period, good grades, lots of working student, integrated into German culture). Thought I’d set myself up for a smooth start into working life. Full-time job offer disappeared because of hiring freeze, student job option blocked by law, now stuck applying in a bad economy with only rejections. Feeling exhausted and demotivated.\n\n\nEDIT:\nWow, thanks everyone for your kind words and for further helps. Reading your comments and stories makes me feel Im not alone in this. Hope we would all soon overcome this terrible period. \nBtw, because some have mentioned: I studied Electrical Engineering but lean more onto the software development side, proficient in C++, Python and looking for a IT job in cities around Frankfurt am Main (sadly moving is not an option for me due because I just moved recently). If someone knows about a matching position somewhere, I would love to learn more about it and we could discuss more in DM. Thanksss everyone",

Alarm went off but I had my earphones in and also didn't really care, then a security guard ran up and grabbed me, checked my bag then gave out to me. Its not something I suspected as being a culture shock but I need to learn, thankfully in lidl it wasn't an issue and I was able to just walk back in but yeah, kind of annoyed as it seems fairly ridiculous to my Irish brain.",
