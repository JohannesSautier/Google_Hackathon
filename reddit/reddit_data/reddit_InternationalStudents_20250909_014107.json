    "selftext": "The US does not owe you anything. It is a simple fact I wish I learned sooner. They will let you study (and maybe work for 1~3 years afterwards), but that's it. They do not need or want you, and they will make it as difficult as possible for you to stay.\n\nI (and many others) were tricked into believing that the F1 visa is the pathway to the American dream, coming to the US in hopes of starting a life here. We were told that after we graduate, we can work on OPT, get a H1B, and eventually get a green card. The truth is that every step past the \"study and graduate\" part is extremely difficult - or nearly impossible.\n\nI realized that I came here with the wrong expectation. I was entitled to enter the US to study, and nothing else. A lot of people (including myself) get mad when they cannot find a job. Or fail to get a H1B visa. Or fail to get a green card. But at the end of the day, none of that was owed to us.\n\nSo here's a piece of advice: Set a realistic expectation. Come here to study, and don't expect anything else. Sure, things will work out for some of you, but it's a very small chance that is getting even smaller. If you are not okay with this, reconsider. You maybe end up in a large pile of debt and going back home disappointed. Just like me and hundreds of thousands of others.",

Canada has tightened on immigration, study/work permits. Many uninformed comments there about how international student permits and visas work. Not everyone has an easy pathways to PR, citizenships, or jobs. This is all very rage bait and a big distraction to deeper issues globally (not just canada).",

Of course it won’t matter to the rich kids - for the less privileged it should become evident very quickly",

    "selftext": "I have loved my career teaching students from all over the world here in the U.S., but I want them all to know that this country is not safe or viable for them anymore. What happened to Harvard and the drastic cuts in research funding are just the tip of the iceberg. We are only 1/12th of the way into the new administration (4 months down, 44 to go) and look what has already happened. \n\nI am not alone in thinking it is also no longer safe for many U.S. citizens and green card holders. I'm leaving this country soon **(I am a white, U.S.-born citizen, and I am still scared).** \n\nPlease watch this video below. Not enough people are taking it seriously (especially Americans themselves because our public education system is so poor, many of them don't understand history and lack critical thinking and even literacy skills beyond the equivalent of a 12-year-old):\n\n[https://youtu.be/IXR9PByA9SY?si=WCBeLcwguX5hQyou](https://youtu.be/IXR9PByA9SY?si=WCBeLcwguX5hQyou)\n\nIf these political and social reasons don't sway you, please know that the job market is TERRIBLE for most fields and with AI and 47's endless machinations, I highly doubt it will get better soon.",

I want to offer a different perspective, however. \n\nI am a brown person from a humble background who first came to the US as an international student. Many decades later, I am now the cofounder of a successful company and a proud American. My story is not unique. I know many who have found belonging, purpose, and opportunity here in America. \n \nYes, it’s true. The current administration has pursued policies that restrict certain forms of protest for non-citizens and generally has applied immigration rules more strictly. But these real issues coexist with another truth: the U.S. remains home to many of the world’s leading universities, research labs, and entrepreneurial ecosystems. It attracts extraordinary talent from all over the world. The handful of stories you read in the news are only a dozen amongst the hundreds of thousands of visas issued every year. \n\nTelling international students “don’t come here” especially as a U.S.-born white citizen, risks ignoring the very real aspirations of people for whom coming here might be a shot at a life of safety, growth, or academic freedom and comes across as an exercise of privilege. \n\nWhen I came to the US as a student, it was Americans whose donations funded the scholarship that made my education possible. A majority of Americans still support people who want to come here to study or contribute in high-skilled jobs. \n\nThe future is uncertain. It always has been. But fear shouldn’t dictate how we pursue our dreams (or how we advise others on theirs).",
