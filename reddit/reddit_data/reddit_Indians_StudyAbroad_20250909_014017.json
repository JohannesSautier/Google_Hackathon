It is. You could've guessed that in a 5-minute Google search. Did you anticipate living overseas, paying tuition, rent, food, and having savings all out of one part-time job?

One of my Indian colleagues had already approached me several times that he would like to move directly to Europe and work with us on site as an internal employee. During the 2022/23 recruitment hype, it actually worked out. He received an offer from us and moved to Europe with the Bluecard. I was his contact person for questions of all kinds in the early days. After the first payslip, he came to me all upset that something might be wrong because so much had been deducted. Out of 6.5k, he had only been paid around 3.7k net. I looked at it and everything was correct. He simply hadn't checked what he had to pay in taxes and mandatory social security contributions. He then resigned after 6 months, also on the grounds that after deducting all costs (high rents in the city, food costs, costs for driver's license and car, other obligatory contributions etc.) there was too little left to save.",

        "body": "It makes sense for the average middle class white American to support Trump. These people need to keep their jobs and make sure there's a secure future for their kids since there's always a chance of highly-skilled immigrants taking their jobs. I don't blame the white people for their leniency towards Trump, Trump came into power in the States for similar reason Modi came into power in India - by winning the Hindu vote.  \n\nI am however, furious at the NRIs and the people of colour who voted for him. These people are the most selfish bastards you'll ever find in the world, they're trying to gatekeep the opportunity of the American dream to themselves and don't want any more people to come there from their native nations. Mexicans voting for Trump is like Chicken defending KFC and that's the same case for the NRIs. It is common knowledge among Indians that NRI executives and managers are the worst people to deal with, they are twice as rude to people of their own race as compared that of people belonging to other races. \n\nThe only way we must act now is stand together and united. Indians don't stand up for other Indians abroad when someone faces racism which is not the case for the African-American or the Latino community. Language barrier also plays a key role here. Most Indians aren't fluent in English which posses a huge problem. I might get downvoted for saying this but the Indian accent is extremely superficial and robot sounding so it's difficult for most native speakers to relate with someone on a deeper level with such a language barrier.  \n\nOne other thing is that Indians need to collectively stop bootlicking criminals like Musk and Trump. Half of the people in this country support Trump without being aware of the horrendous things he has done. Musk being a top-tier racist is no surprise to me, he's an extremely white man of German origin who grew up in South Africa and bathed in the money of his apartheid exploiting and paedophilic father. Same with Bill Gates, he's not innocent either yet people treat him here as some kind of celebrity.   \n\n\nThe bottom line is, until we're able to Make India Great Again, no one in this world will take us seriously and consider us as equal to them, at least on an economic level. But in the current landscape, Making India Great Again is impossible, we're the most divided country in the world and directors of top institutes like IIT Madras publicly support drinking cow piss. We've brought our own damnation upon ourselves.",

They (we) just bring along our own culture and settle in indian majority neighbourhoods. Also bringing along our dirty sanitary standards (road ke side ka kachra). \n\nAnd i get it why. Because it's just easy to stay indian. It's hard to learn a new culture. New language, new standards, new expectations from others, new norms in society.\n\nOfcourse there will be racists everywhere who are racist without a reason.

    "selftext": "Hi.\n\nThis post is not meant for gate-keeping or for discouraging you. So please read it completely before reacting negatively in the comments.\n\n**My Background:**\n\nI have been preparing to come to Germany for past 3 years before my bachelors even started. My degree got completed last year May, I scored a really good CGPA in my subject and I got the opportunity to come here subsequently for Masters. I started learning German from April last year and it has been around 9 months. I can understand many sentences and can speak German without many issues. I am currently at the B2 level.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**Jobs:**\n\nJobs are very less here since the economy went down and they don't expect it to recover any time soon.  Many of the German companies are going bankrupt and others like Volkswagen, BMW on the verge of it. The unemployment level is said to rise substantially and they will prefer their own country men before us obviously. Companies like Siemens receive 2000-3000 applicants for a single job posting. I have personally applied to over 200+ jobs with B2 level German, but haven't gotten a single call back yet.  I hope the situation will become better in the future.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**Racism:**\n\nI don't have to say anything here. There is unreasonable amount of racism towards Indians online and I have experienced its spillovers to real life here. You will face all kinds of subtle racism including people shifting to other seats on bus, people staring at you in the street. Even in university chat groups you can see people targeting Indians for being smelly or for scamming others. Recently in such a group the admin warned us of a particular scam out there and many people replied \" block everyone having number starting with +91\", \"always the smelly ones\" etc. The scary part is that no one even defended us including our own brethren. The admin also let it slide by.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**Others:**\n\nThe subjects/courses are tough here. One can't just rote learn for exams, but has to understand everything. It is a good thing to study this way. But combine it with work, cooking, cleaning and one will have no time left to study properly. I never knew it would become this hectic\n\nThe prices of food items are so high here. The rent I am paying is 450+ euros and this is for a town in Germany not a big city.\n\nLife is really lonely out here, Indians form groups according to their states in India and gate-keep it from other Indians. For my experience, Germans themselves are not that social people, maybe its because I am brown. Idk.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**Advice:**\n\nI am currently planning to complete my studies, earn some money to pay back my loans and return back to India. I wish I had never come here. They will treat you as you are some sort of asylum seeker. I suggest anyone who is planning to come here to double think before you do so. Indians who have become successful in Germany are the ones who came here during the period of 2015-2020, the golden era of immigration. But the people who have come here recently including me are finding it really hard to survive. There is not really any shortage of workers here except in healthcare field.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**Exceptions:**\n\nIf you have good amount of money and/or want to actually research and study and have C1 level German, then this post doesn't apply to you. Best of luck\n\nIf you are a nurse or in the healthcare field you actually have a lot of opportunities here, so this post doesn't apply to you too.\n\nSincerely\n\nYour Brother\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**Edit:**\n\nThis post became more viral than I expected. My original intention was to share my personal experience as a heads-up for those considering coming here. However, I’ve seen others share completely different, more positive experiences as well. I encourage everyone to look at various experiences and form their own opinions. It might also be helpful to connect with those who moved here last semester to get an idea of what's really going on. Wishing everyone the best of luck!\n\nmy\\_qualifications",

But combine it with work, cooking, cleaning and one will have no time left to study properly. I never knew it would become this hectic\n\nThe prices of food items are so high here. The rent I am paying is 450+ euros and this is for a town in Germany not a big city. \n\nLife is really lonely out here, Indians form groups according to their states in India and gate-keep it from other Indians. For my experience, Germans themselves are not that social people, maybe its because I am brown. Idk. \n\n**Advice:**\n\nI am currently planning to complete my studies, earn some money to pay back my loans and return back to India. I wish I had never come here. They will treat you as you are some sort of asylum seeker. I suggest anyone who is planning to come here to double think before you do so. Indians who have become successful in Germany are the ones who came here during the period of 2015-2020, the golden era of immigration. But the people who have come here recently including me are finding it really hard to survive. There is not really any shortage of workers here except in healthcare field. \n\n**Exceptions:**\n\nIf you have good amount of money and/or are want to actually research and study and have C1 level German, then this post doesn't apply to you. Best of luck\n\nIf you are a nurse or in the healthcare field you actually have a lot of opportunities here, so this post doesn't apply to you too. \n\n  \nSincerely \n\nYour Brother\n\nmy\\_qualifications\n\n  \"\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "body": "I came to Germany in 2020, as you mentioned, during the golden period of immigration. Things are quite different now compared to back then, and finding a job has become very challenging for students. I have personally seen many master’s students who, after graduating, couldn’t secure a job and decided to pursue a PhD to remain in Germany while earning a salary. PhDs are considered full-time jobs here, which helps them stay afloat during tough times.\n\nI am currently a Senior Manager at a German company, and my company has been under a hiring freeze for the past two years. If you need specific advice about finding jobs, please feel free to reach out—I’d be more than happy to help.\n\nThings will improve in the future, so hang in there. Germany is still the third-largest economy in the world and is far more resilient than the media often portrays.",

You either have people complaining about gatekeeping or absolutely dumb ass posts along the lines of \"Hi, I want to go abroad, please curate a list of countries, universities and programs for me\". Christ man, should I also prepare your bottle of milk and tuck you in bed at night??\n\nIf you post an extremely generic low quality question, don't be surprised if you get negative responses that seem to be gatekeeping. If you can't even put in the efforts to do your research, provide proper context and ask specific and relevant questions, how do you think you're going to survive in a foreign land, with no support, stress of debt, loneliness, burden of chores, high academic load, etc etc. Call it gatekeeping, but if negative responses change such people's mind, either by scrapping their study abroad plans or actually putting in efforts to get their shit together, then that's a good outcome either way. \n\nOn the other hand, I appreciate well thought out posts that provide good context and ask specific questions. I'm happy to answer those as I was once helped myself by various people so it's only fair to help those who are in the same situation I once was. \n\nThough again, I cannot emphasize enough on the importance of personal research. Ultimately we're strangers on internet. No one else knows the complete context of your life. Your skills, your personality, your long term goals, your financial risk appetite, your emotional resilience, your family situation, etc. If you're clear and confident about those things and ask good questions, I would be very surprised if you receive gatekeeping replies. There are enough people here providing good advice, but they cannot spoonfeed you, and neither should you want them to.",

After 12th was completed, I was resolute on leaving the country to pursue a new life in a new nation. Alas, covid was in full swing, and my dad advised me to stay back and complete my graduation, and then apply for masters.\n\nSo, I persevered. Once I completed my graduation, I yet again looked across the horizon, for new opportunities. I did thorough research and applied to only one country. I even joined a counselling service so nothing could go wrong. When they asked me some preliminary questions, I aced all of them, and I even provided them with information about the country they didn't even know. I was so confident that I left the service, applied to several colleges, accepted in a few, and then the visa all on my own. Then, the train hit- my visa was rejected. The degree I had chosen was worth it in only that country, and anywhere else would be a colossal waste of money. Most of the good university applications were closed anyway, so I had no choice but to stay back and take a drop.\n\nI was devasted. By now, most of my sheeple engineering friends were already abroad. I wasted so much time and money and now I had a useless degree and no job prospects. By some miracle, I one day received a call from my old counselling service. They had heard about my failure but were so impressed with my research that they offered me a job lmao. Seeing no other option, I took up the job. It's a local service and the pay is decent. So, now I help students accomplish what I couldn't do- send them abroad.\n\n(Read from here if you skipped)\n\nI don't accept money for anything here, as I genuinely just want to help students make good decisions in their lives, which I couldn't. I've been working for a year, and I have seen some repetitive mistakes that a lot of students make, that I see on this subreddit as well. There are general trends in countries, and the most recent one seems to be Germany. I understand the desperation of many people who want to leave the country, but you need to understand that the year or two you spend doing a masters now will cost you the rest of your life.\n\nCalm down, evaluate your options, research whether your course is valuable in that country, research the politics, economics and history of every country you're applying to if your goal is a PR. I have seen so many students my counselling service sent abroad now return to their hometowns because they take up the first university they get an offer from. Some can't even point the country on a map and they want a PR there!  \nI spend most of my free time reading articles and watching youtube videos related to this, as it is literally my job. So, if you're planning on moving to another country as a student, AMA.\n\nNOTE: please don't DM me and ask your questions publicly. Other people can have the same questions in the future and this can be a good resource to them.\n\nEDIT: This got way more traction than I was expecting. I will answer all the questions eventually, give me some time please\n\nEDIT 2: Please don't expect me to answer if you give me a generic 1-2 line question.\n\nEDIT 3: I got way too many questions, and since a lot were repetitive I have made another post [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indians_StudyAbroad/comments/1fcnqwi/a_detailed_review_of_every_english_speaking/)clearing some common doubts.

My main obstacle is my CGPA in Electronics engineering (5.8).  Multiple people have suggested me to take GRE and pursue MS in US, for which I would have to take a loan. However seeing the saturation in IT sector rn, as well as the drop in placements this year, makes me doubtful whether this would be a fruitful investment.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on what career paths I can look up from here?",

        "body": "Hi, I graduated this year and I've completed my bachelor's in CSE with a CGPA of 8.95.\nI am currently working in a company and I would like to gain experience of a year or two and then planning to study abroad.\n\nI want to pursue masters in CS too and I have Germany in my mind because of the less tuition fee. But everywhere I see it all comes down to speaking german fluently or you won't get a job. So I'm confused about it. But I'm planning to finish till A2 level while I work for 2 years.\n\nAnother country I had in mind was netherlands because it being an English speaking country. But the cost of studying and the living expenses sums up to a pretty hefty amount. I've researched about some universities and the scholarships they offer but I would like to know about the chances of me getting it or on other words how many students would get it out of all the students that apply.\n\nAnd it would also be great of you could suggest me some countries. My budget being around 35 L.\n\nThanks in advance!",
